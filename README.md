hcbridge - Software and Hardware Co-Design Acceleration Framework & Toolset
==========================================

hcbridge is an open source framework & toolset by software and hardware co-design concept to implement complex algorithm.<br>
It optimize to large complicated data throughout system with low latency, such as HEVC Encoder.<br>
It is easy to use toolsets, that automatic generate interface code for HW and SW side.<br>
